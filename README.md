Chitter Challenge
=================

To create this app I have used:

* pg gem for the database connection. 
* RSpec to write tests.
* Sinatra, the webrick gem and rack-test in order to set up and write the routes and to be able to run the app locally.
* BCrypt in order to encrypt the passwords so they are hashed and cannot be accessed through the db.
* Mail and Pony gems in order to set up the emails being sent.

Notes on running the app and the tests:

* Before trying to run the app use the bundle install command in the terminal to ensure the gems are all installed and ready to be run.
* To run the app use the rackup command in the terminal.
* To run the tests use the rspec command in the terminal.
* Right now in the app.rb file the from: email (line 147) is an example email so the tests run, however, it means the emails wonâ€™t actually be sent - if you want to send an email change the from: email to a real email address and the email will be sent (ensuring you have signed in and logged in with a working email address).
